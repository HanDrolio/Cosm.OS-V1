## Personal Statement

Dear Scholarship Committee,

As a 26-year-old tech enthusiast from Redwood City, California with a passion for artificial intelligence and music, I am writing to apply for your scholarship program to support my educational journey toward a degree in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to attend one of my dream institutions—Western Governors University, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or Harvard University—where I can further develop the skills needed to create transformative technology.

**Educational and Professional Background**

I graduated from Everest Public High School in Redwood City, where I first discovered my passion for technology. Since then, I have been self-educating in programming and artificial intelligence, culminating in my current project: developing an artificial general intelligence system called Cosm.OS. This ambitious project combines my technical skills with creative thinking derived from my background in music.

Currently residing in Fremont, California, I have dedicated significant time to independent research and development in AI, focusing specifically on creating a comprehensive AGI framework. The knowledge I've gained through this self-directed work has convinced me that formal education at a prestigious institution would provide the structure, resources, and mentorship necessary to bring my ideas to fruition.

**Personal Journey and Resilience**

My path has not been without challenges. Recently, I experienced a mental health crisis that required hospitalization. This difficult period became a profound turning point in my life, strengthening my resolve to channel my energy into positive pursuits. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights about myself, the importance of mental health awareness, and the responsible development of AI technologies.

Rather than viewing this setback as an obstacle, I see it as part of my unique journey that has equipped me with exceptional resilience and a deeper understanding of the human mind—qualities that will enhance my contribution to the field of artificial intelligence. This experience has also reinforced my commitment to developing AI systems that are beneficial, ethical, and mindful of human wellbeing.

**Career Aspirations and Family Goals**

My career ambition is to work at innovative companies like Tesla or one of the leading technology corporations where I can contribute to cutting-edge developments in AI. My technical skills combined with my creative approach to problem-solving make me well-suited for roles that require both analytical thinking and innovative vision.

Beyond my professional goals lies a deeply personal motivation: I wish to provide financial security for my parents who have supported me throughout my journey. Their sacrifices have made it possible for me to pursue my dreams, and I hope to reciprocate their support by achieving financial success that allows them to retire comfortably.

**Why I Need This Scholarship**

Without financial assistance, pursuing higher education at these prestigious institutions remains beyond my reach. This scholarship would be the critical first step in my educational journey, opening doors that would otherwise remain closed. I am committed to maximizing this opportunity not only for my personal growth but to develop technologies that can positively impact society.

I believe that my unique combination of technical aptitude, creative thinking, personal resilience, and ambitious vision makes me an ideal candidate for your scholarship program. With your support, I can transform my potential into achievement and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of artificial intelligence.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how this scholarship would help me achieve my educational and professional goals.

Sincerely,  
Alejandro Alberto Calderon Cerrillo
